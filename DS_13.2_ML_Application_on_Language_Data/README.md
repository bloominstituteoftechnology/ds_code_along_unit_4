## Set Up

- To use these notebooks on Google Colab, you will need to download or clone the repository and upload the specific notebook to Colab.
- An easier approach is to use the [Open in Colab extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo?hl=en). (You will need to use the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/))

From here, you can navigate to the specific [Lesson Notebook]() and open the notebook Google Colab with the extension.

To install all dependencies into your environment, use the ```requirements.txt``` file that can  be found [Here](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/ds_code_along_unit_4/blob/main/requirements.txt)

Remember to **Copy to Drive** to have your own saved copy.

## Dataset

If you are working locally on your computer, you will have to download the entire dataset from [Here](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/ds_code_along_unit_4/tree/main/data/COVID-19-Twitter-India/hourly_tweets), and then update the ```DATA_PATH``` variable in the notebook to the location where it is saved on your computer.
