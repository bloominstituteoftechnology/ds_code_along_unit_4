# Tune and Regularize Neural Networks Code-Along

## Set Up

- To use this notebook on Google Colab, you will need to download or clone the repository and upload the specific notebook to Colab.
- An easier approach is to use the [Open in Colab extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo?hl=en). (You will need to use the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/))

From here, you can click on the [Lesson Notebook](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/ds_code_along_unit_4/blob/main/DS_14.2_Tune_and_Regularize_Neural_Networks/starter_notebook/14_2_Tune_and_Regularize_NNs_Starter.ipynb) and open the notebook Google Colab with the extension.

Remember to **Copy to Drive** to have your own saved copy.

## Using the Kaggle API

During this Code-Along we will be using the Kaggle API to access the dataset. You'll need to acquire your own `kaggle.json` file and then upload this file to your Google Colab instance in order to access the dataset. 

Here are the steps you should take to obtain your own `kaggle.json` file:

1. Go to kaggle.com and log-in or create an account.
2. On the upper tab, click on 'Account'.
3. Once you do that, you'll see API and below that, "Create New API Token."
4. After clicking the "Create New API Token," a file named "kaggle.json" will be downloaded.
5. Upload this file into your Colab notebook, just as you would with a data set.

**Please Note:** You can reuse the same .json file, you don't need to create a new API token each time you want to connect to Kaggle.
